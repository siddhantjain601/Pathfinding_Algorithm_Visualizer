## 🧮 **Algorithm Deep Dive**

### **🎯 Dijkstra's Algorithm**
```
Purpose: Guaranteed shortest weighted path
Best For: When you need the absolute optimal route
Real-World: GPS navigation, network routing, supply chain optimization
Complexity: O(V² + E) or O((V + E) log V) with priority queue
```

### **⭐ A* Search**  
```
Purpose: Optimized weighted pathfinding with heuristic guidance
Best For: When you know the target location (most pathfinding scenarios)
Real-World: Game AI, robotics navigation, route planning
Complexity: O(b^d) where b is branching factor, d is depth
```

### **🌊 Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
```
Purpose: Shortest unweighted path (by node count)
Best For: When all moves have equal cost
Real-World: Social networks, web crawling, puzzle solving
Complexity: O(V + E)
```

### **🕳️ Depth-First Search (DFS)**
```
Purpose: Deep exploration, not optimized for shortest paths
Best For: Graph traversal, cycle detection, topological sorting
Real-World: Maze solving, dependency resolution, backtracking problems
Complexity: O(V + E)
```
